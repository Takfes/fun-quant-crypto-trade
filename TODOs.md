## TODOs

- create S/R and S/D features
- create model training pipeline
- labels -> check if need to shift(-1) to avoid leakage
- create backtrader strategy leveraging trained model
- explore the threshold optimization & predict_proba calibration
- create Volume-Weighted Moving Averages (VWMA) features
- explore mtf analysis - how to incorporate relevant features
- features.divergence -> distinguish between bullish and bearish divergence
